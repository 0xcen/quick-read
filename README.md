# QuickRead

**Speed reading, reimagined for your Mac.**

I saw [this mega viral tweet](https://x.com/UltraLinx/status/2011434505253650868) from Oliur about RSVP speed reading and couldn't stop thinking about it. I wanted a way to lock in and focus on quick reading any text, articles, posts, whatever, without distractions. Full screen. Just me and the words.

[traf built a gorgeous Raycast extension](https://github.com/traf/parse) that nailed the concept. But I wanted something standalone, something that takes over your screen and blocks everything else out. So I built this.

## The science (quick version)

When you read normally, your eyes jump around the page in little hops called saccades. Each hop takes time. Each hop breaks focus. RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) eliminates all that — words come to you instead of you going to them.

The red letter you see? That's the ORP (Optimal Recognition Point). It's where your brain naturally wants to look first in a word. We highlight it and keep it centered so your eyes never have to move. Just absorb.

## Quick start

- **⌘⇧R** Grabs whatever article you're looking at in your browser and starts reading
- **⌘⇧E** Picks up right where you left off
- **Space** Pause/play
- **↑↓** Speed up or slow down
- **Esc** Exit

## Installing

1. Download the DMG from Releases
2. Drag to Applications
3. That's it

(First launch: right-click → Open, because we're not paying Apple $99/year to tell you we're trustworthy)

## Features

- **Full-screen immersive overlay** Frosted glass background, everything else fades away
- **RSVP with ORP highlighting** Red focus letter always centered, eyes never move
- **Browser integration** Extracts the main article content from any webpage (like Safari's Reader Mode) and works with Safari, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Atlas, Dia, Commet
- **Clipboard fallback** For Twitter/X and JS-heavy sites, just copy the text first
- **Adjustable speed** 300-700 WPM, persists between sessions
- **Reading history** Resume where you left off, tracks progress across articles
- **Smart resume** Optionally rewind 1-5 sentences when resuming for context
- **Countdown options** 3-2-1-GO before reading, configurable for fresh starts vs resumes
- **Keyboard-first** Global hotkeys, full control without touching the mouse
- **Menu bar app** Lives quietly in your menu bar, out of the way
- **Auto-hiding UI** Controls and cursor fade when you're in the zone
